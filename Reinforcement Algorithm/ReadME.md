## What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement learning  (RL) is a machine learning technique that focuses on how AI agents should take actions in an environment to maximize the total reward. The training is done in real time with continuous feedback to maximize the possibility of being rewarded.
+ It's one of the three basic machine learning types. The other two are supervised and unsupervised learning.
+ Reinforcement learning lets a machine learn from its mistakes, similar to how humans do. It's a type of machine learning in which the machine learns to solve a problem using trial and error. Also, the machine learns from its actions, unlike supervised learning, where historical data plays a critical role.
+ The AI system that undergoes the learning process is called the agent or the learner. The learning system explores and observes the environment around it, just like us. If the agent performs the right action, it receives positive feedback or a positive reward. If it takes an adverse action, it receives negative feedback or a negative reward.

## How does reinforcement learning work?

Since reinforcement learning is how most organisms learn, let's look at how a dog learns new tricks, and compare them with this machine learning type.

Charlie is a Golden Retriever. Like other dogs, he doesn't understand English or any human language per se, although he can comprehend intonation and human body language with excellent accuracy.

This means that we can't directly instruct Charlie on what to do, but we can use treats to entice him into doing something. It could be anything as simple as sitting or rolling over on command or shaking hands. For this example, let's consider the “act of shaking hands”.

As you probably know, the rules are pretty simple. If Charlie shakes hands or does something similar, he gets a treat. If he doesn't obey or misbehaves, he won't get any treats. 

In other words, if Charlie performs the desired action, he gets a treat; otherwise, none.

After a few "treat or no treat" iterations, Charlie will recognize the right set of actions to perform to get a treat. When he misbehaved, he realized that such unfavorable actions led to unfavorable consequences. In the future, when Charlie faces similar situations, he’ll know which is the most desirable action to take to maximize the treat or reward.
