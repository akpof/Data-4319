## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is applied to **real valued** target functions in order to predict a range of possible outputs for a given input. 

Linear Regression is one of the simplest algorithms in machine learning under supervised learning and it can be trained in different ways. However at this time  I'll be using the closed-form of linear regression.

The goal of the Linear regression is to find the best fit line that can accurately predict the output for the continuous dependent variable

## How does Linear Regression work?

This is a simple introduction to the closed-form of linear regression for machine learning with an example given using the Julia programming language. In this regression model, we will predict the salary that a software developer is expected to make based upon their age.kk


Linear regression is an attractive model because the representation is so simple. The representation is a linear equation that combines a specific set of input values (x) the solution to which is the predicted output for that set of input values (y). As such, both the input values (x) and the output value are numeric
