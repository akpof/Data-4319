## What is Linear Regression?
linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is applied to real valued target functions in order to predict a range of possible outputs for a given input.

## How does Linear Regression work?

Linear regression is an attractive model because the representation is so simple. The representation is a linear equation that combines a specific set of input values (x) the solution to which is the predicted output for that set of input values (y). As such, both the input values (x) and the output value are numeric

Linear Regression is the process of finding a line that best fits the data points available on the plot, so that we can use it to predict output values for inputs that are not present in the data set we have, with the belief that those outputs would fall on the line.
