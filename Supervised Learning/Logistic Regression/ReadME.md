## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification, that is for predictions of the type this or that, yes or no, A or B, etc. Logistic regression can, however, be used for multiclass classification, but here we will focus on its simplest application. It is one of the most frequently used machine learning algorithms for binary classifications that translates the input to 0 or 1. 


## How does Logistic Regression work?

Logistic Regression uses a more complex cost function than Linear Regression, this cost function is called the ‘Sigmoid function’ or also known as the ‘logistic function’ instead of a linear function.

The hypothesis of logistic regression tends to limit the cost function between 0 and 1. Therefore linear functions fail to represent it as it can have a value greater than 1 or less than 0 which is not possible as per the hypothesis of logistic regression.
