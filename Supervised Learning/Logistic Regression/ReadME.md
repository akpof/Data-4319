## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability. it is a  popular statistical model used for binary classification, that is for predictions of the type this or that, yes or no, A or B, etc.It is one of the most frequently used machine learning algorithms for binary classifications that translates the input to 0 or 1. 


## How does Logistic Regression work?

Logistic Regression is a “Supervised machine learning” algorithm that can be used to model the probability of a certain class or event. It is used when the data is linearly separable and the outcome is binary or dichotomous in nature.

The hypothesis of logistic regression tends to limit the cost function between 0 and 1. Therefore linear functions fail to represent it as it can have a value greater than 1 or less than 0 which is not possible as per the hypothesis of logistic regression.
