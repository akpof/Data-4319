**Description:**
Clustering‚Äù is the process of grouping similar entities together. The goal of this unsupervised machine learning technique is to find similarities in the data point and group similar data points together.


**Variables:**
  + features
 

**Types of algorithms:**
+ **Clustering:** 
  + Finding similarities/patterns in observed data
  + e.g. [K-Means](https://github.com/Dnsibu/NsibuD_DATA_4319/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/01-K%20Means), SVD, PCA, Hierarchical custering
+ **Association:**
  + Identify sequences. Identify new and interesting insights between different objects in a set.
  + e.g. Frequent Pattern-Growth, Apriori Algorithm
