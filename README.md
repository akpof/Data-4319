## Basic  Description of the course
The major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose. Machine learning models are designed to make the most accurate predictions possible. Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables.... Statistics is the mathematical study of data.

This is a  senior level data science course that blends  the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition as well as the algorithmic perspectives of machine learning. Topics include, but are not limited to: essential components of learning, feasibility of learning, linear models (the perceptron learning algorithm, linear regression, logistic regression), deep neural nets, stochastic gradient descent, and modeling with TensorFlow (and Flux).
